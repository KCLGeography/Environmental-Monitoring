# Environmental-Monitoring
This repo contains the open-source environmental monitoring hardware designs detailed in our *Low-cost electronic sensors for environmental research: pitfalls and opportunities* paper. Designs are included in their individual folders:  
**1. [Basic versatile logger](https://github.com/KCLGeography/environmental-monitoring/tree/master/basic-logger)**  
**2. [Water table depth probe](https://github.com/KCLGeography/environmental-monitoring/tree/master/depth-probe)**  
**3. [Air quality logger](https://github.com/KCLGeography/environmental-monitoring/tree/master/air-quality)**  
**4. [Water quality logger](https://github.com/KCLGeography/environmental-monitoring/tree/master/water-quality)**  
**5. [Time-sequencing lake sediment trap](https://github.com/KCLGeography/environmental-monitoring/blob/master/lake-sediment)**  
**6. [High-frequency measurements of wind-blown sand](https://github.com/KCLGeography/environmental-monitoring/tree/master/Aeolean-sediment-measurer)**  

Schematics and build instructions for the **Freestation Automated Weather Stations** and other specific designs can be found at [www.freestation.org](http://www.freestation.org)
